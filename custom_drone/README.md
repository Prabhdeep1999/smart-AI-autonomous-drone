A smart autonomous drone with Real-Time Object Detection capabilities.

This part of project focuses on building a drone from scratch then making it autonomous and making it smart using Nvidia Jetson TX2.

Full drone building instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/redtail/wiki/Skypad-TBS-Discovery-Setup).

This also has a React website to show real-time alerts and a Flutter App for initiating the flight.
